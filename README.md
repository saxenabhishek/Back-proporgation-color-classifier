# Back-proporgation-color-classifier

It's a program to demonstrate Back propagation.
It classifies colors based on their base which could be black or white.
The nural network consists of 3 input neurons for RGB normalised inputs.
There is a middle layer with 4 neurons and a output layer with 2 neurons for black and white. 

Note that the network could be simplified with simmilar results but the whole idea of this project was for me to understand how these networks work.

I manually selected colors and decided their bases to crete some data to test the algo
